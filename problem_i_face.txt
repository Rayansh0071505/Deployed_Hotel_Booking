1) while deploying the model , you have to train the model in latest dependencies as deploying websites/server like render,streamlit
   works on latest version for me i stuck in numpy i.e

   """ error 
    input_features = np.array(label_encoded_features).reshape(1, -1)
ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. 
The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. The detected shape was (31,) + inhomogeneous part.

as i was using numpy old version while render using latest version so this thing was first problem
as numpy cant work on inhomogeneous parts i.e if a list contain number it all should be same datatype, it cant contain object, int, and 
other datatype together so 

solution
so first i install latest numpy dependencies
then i take all input as dtype = object then later on for pridiction i convert whole as integer
i.e                 encoded_value = labelencoder.fit_transform([str(input_features[i])])  # Ensure the input is a string
